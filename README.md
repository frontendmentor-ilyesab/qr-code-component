## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The main point of learning in this challenge since it's my first one. was taking the design from the images of the mobile version and desktop version and think of a way to structure the html to allow me to style the different components of the challenge in an easy way.

I also introduced myself to variable fonts a concept I was not aware of.

### Continued development

As part of working on this project I'm interested in learning more about variable fonts and typography in general.
